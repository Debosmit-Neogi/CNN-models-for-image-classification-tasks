#convolutional neural networks-models-for-image-classification-tasks

Multiclass Image Classification using Convolutional Neural networks : Various CNN models were used to implement this task and that resulted in various accuracies.
The CNN models include:Transfer Learning ( Xception, inceptionV3, inceptionResnetV2)
All these models added with varied input images, data augmentations and other techniques resulted in varing accuracies

This project is created in Google collab in GPU runtime for faster execution of the codes.
I've used 10 epochs for each section of model to get the validation accuracy and validation loss.
